# Bulk Email Broadcast

A **bulk email broadcast module** built with **Angular**, **Node.js**, and **Microsoft SQL Server** for sending job-related emails to selected candidates inside an ATS / recruitment workflow.

This module allows recruiters to select candidates from a candidate matching or candidate management screen and send a broadcast email with job details, recruiter notes, and candidate-specific targeting.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Bulk Email Broadcast** module is designed for recruiter workflows where multiple shortlisted or matched candidates need to receive the same email communication about a job opening, follow-up, interview process, or outreach campaign.

Instead of manually sending emails one by one, recruiters can:

* select multiple candidates using checkboxes
* auto-fill email recipients / BCC
* inject job title and job description into the message
* compose recruiter notes
* send a single broadcast to all selected candidates

This module is useful for **ATS platforms, candidate matching workflows, recruiter outreach systems, and hiring communication tools**.

---

## ✨ Features

## 1) Candidate Selection Based Email Sending

Recruiters can:

* select one or more candidates from a list
* trigger email sending only for selected candidates
* avoid sending to the entire matched candidate pool

---

## 2) Auto BCC Population

The module automatically collects selected candidate email addresses and:

* populates the **BCC** field
* supports recruiter-side bulk communication flow
* reduces manual copy/paste effort

---

## 3) Job-Aware Email Composition

The email composer can automatically prefill:

* **email subject** using job details
* **job description / note section**
* recruiter note or message body context

This helps standardize outreach emails and improves recruiter productivity.

---

## 4) Recruiter Email Composer UI

A recruiter can review and edit:

* **To / From / BCC**
* email subject
* job description / recruiter note
* selected candidate count
* final message content before sending

---

## 5) Broadcast Payload Generation

The frontend can build a clean payload with:

* selected candidate IDs
* selected email addresses
* job ID / job title
* recruiter note
* message subject / content

The backend uses this payload to send the email broadcast.

## 🗄️ Example SQL Table Structure

### Email Broadcast Log Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmailBroadcastLog (
    BroadcastId INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    JobId INT NULL,
    Subject NVARCHAR(255),
    Note NVARCHAR(MAX),
    SentBy INT NULL,
    CandidateCount INT DEFAULT 0,
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```

### Email Broadcast Recipients Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmailBroadcastRecipients (
    RecipientId INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    BroadcastId INT NOT NULL,
    CandidateId INT NULL,
